        <h2>About Credit Scoring</h2>
        <p>
          Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders and
          financial institutions to determine the creditworthiness of a person
          or a small, owner-operated business. A credit score is a number
          between 300â€“850 that depicts a consumer's creditworthiness. The higher
          the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Credit scoring models are used by financial institutions, credit card
          companies, and others to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending
          money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt. Credit
          scores are used by lenders, including banks providing mortgage loans,
          credit card companies, and car dealerships financing auto purchases,
          to decide whether to offer credit (such as a loan or a credit card) to
          consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most widely used credit scores are FICO scores, the credit scores
          created by Fair Isaac Corporation. FICO scores are used by many
          lenders, and there are several types of FICO scores that vary
          depending on the type of credit product being considered, such as an
          auto loan or mortgage.
